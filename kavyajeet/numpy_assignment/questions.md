Python NumPy (Array, Random, Math): 

- Write a Python program to print the NumPy version in your system. 
- Write a Python program to reverse an array (first element becomes last). 
- Write a Python program to convert a list and tuple into arrays. 
- Write a Python program to find common values between two arrays. 
- Write a Python program compare two arrays using numpy. 
- Write a Python program to change the dimension of an array. 
- Write a Python program (using numpy) to sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 100. 
- Write a Python program to convert a NumPy array into Python list structure.

- How to ignore all numpy warnings (not recommended)? 
- How to swap two rows of an array? 
- Compute bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals for the mean of a 1D array X (i.e., resample the elements of an array with replacement N times, compute the mean of each sample, and then compute percentiles over the means). 
- Python program to create a random vector of size 10 and sort it.
